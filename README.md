# ðŸš— Accident Detection System using CNN and ResNet50 in 3D Architecture

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a deep learning-based **Accident Detection System** designed to identify vehicular accidents in real-time from video data. Leveraging **3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs)** and a pretrained **ResNet50** architecture, the system processes sequences of frames to learn both spatial and temporal features â€” enabling it to detect sudden movements, collisions, and anomalies typical of road accidents.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Detect accidents from dashcam, surveillance, or traffic footage.
- Utilize **3D CNN** for spatiotemporal feature extraction.
- Integrate **ResNet50** for deep residual learning and accurate classification.
- Enable near real-time predictions for safety monitoring systems.

## ðŸ“· How It Works

1. **Frame Extraction**  
   Input video is divided into sequences of frames (clips), typically 16â€“32 frames long.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Each clip is resized, normalized, and formatted into a tensor for model input.

3. **Model Architecture**  
   - **ResNet50** is used as the base feature extractor.
   - Extended with **3D convolutional layers** to capture motion over time.
   - Final dense layers classify whether an accident has occurred.

4. **Prediction**  
   The model returns a binary label: `Accident` or `Normal`.
